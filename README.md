Code Architecture & Organization

Modular Structure: Split functionality into dedicated classes (GameState, UIManager, GameManager, PerformanceMonitor)
Utility Functions: Created a Utils class for common operations like number formatting and animations
Better State Management: Added validation, error handling, and data integrity checks
Performance Monitoring: Added FPS counter and optimized rendering

User Experience Enhancements

Responsive Design: Better mobile/tablet support with flexible layouts
Enhanced Visuals:

Smooth animations and transitions
Screen shake effects on critical threat
Pulsing nodes and data flow animations on the network map
Visual feedback for affordable upgrades


Improved Feedback: More detailed logging with timestamps and categories
Keyboard Shortcuts: Space to inject, R to recompile
Better Loading States: Improved splash screen and loading indicators

Game Mechanics Improvements

Enhanced Node System: Nodes now drift slightly and have different visual effects
Better Upgrade Display: Added lore text and visual indicators for affordable upgrades
Uptime Tracking: Shows how long the current session has been running
More Varied Events: Different infection messages and random bonus events
State Validation: Prevents save corruption and handles edge cases

Technical Improvements

Performance Optimization:

Debounced saving and resize events
Capped delta time to prevent large jumps
Optimized canvas rendering with device pixel ratio support


Error Handling: Try-catch blocks around save/load operations
Memory Management: Limited log entries and node counts
Accessibility: Better ARIA labels and semantic HTML

Visual Polish

Modern UI: Enhanced gradients, shadows, and hover effects
Animated Elements: Loading states, button effects, and visual feedback
Better Typography: Improved hierarchy and readability
Color Coding: Threat levels now have distinct visual states
Grid Background: Animated grid on the network map for a more "digital" feel
